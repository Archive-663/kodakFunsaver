### What would be helpful:
- digi-Process C-41 Lightroom Preset

    [Lightroom Presets](https://github.com/Archive-663/lightroomPresets)

    This preset develops your photos for a flat base reminiscent of old Kodak negative scans. It does not remove the distortion as it is a characteristic of the lens and of the photos that are produced with film. If you want to remove the distortion; set your distortion slider to ~ -12.

### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL.

Please view the printOrientation.3mf file for help with orienting the parts on the printer bed. 

### Assembly help:
Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble.
