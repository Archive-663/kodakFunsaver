# Lot no.004 | A Rehousing for Kodak Funsaver Lenses
Unexpect the Expected. digi-Process C-41 Lens Adapter for Kodak Funsaver

The Loudness of Noise

You hate waiting for film to be processed and wish it was instant. But I want that analogue feel without the analogue burden.

I keep these memories, looking through old photos with a wash of nostalgia. Each tell a different story, but the same one every time.

The photographs, while taken quickly and blasé, tell a story once only told through cheap disposable cameras. While you think they are poor imitations, I see them as an homage to a time when we were children documenting our family trips. This lens adapter is a return to our childlike innocence and spontaneity.

The loudness of noise is a link to the past. A link to a time when we waited for the one hour film developer to process our memories.

Nostalgia — it sells.

    This preset develops your photos for a flat base reminiscent of old Kodak negative scans. It does not remove the distortion as it is a characteristic of the lens and of the photos that are produced with film. If you want to remove the distortion; set your distortion slider to ~ -12.

### For DSLRs:
Please use mirror lock up before inserting lens into place. Additionally, some DSLRs from Canon no longer allow mirror lock up to function like it did on previous models. The 5d Mark IV, and the 6d Mark II don't work the same as the previous models so they will not allow this lens to work as designed. There will be more than what's listed here, so check your camera to see if it still supports firing the shutter without checking to see if the mirror is actuating.

### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL.

Please view the printOrientation.3mf file for help with orienting the parts on the printer bed. 

### Assembly help:
I suggest drilling holds to their correct tap size before tapping. The M1.6 holes should be drilled out to 1.4mm then tapped with the M1.6 tap.

When assembling the rotating assemblies use some synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the rotate function smoother.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble.
