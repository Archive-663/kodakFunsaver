The Loudness of Noise

You hate waiting for film to be processed and wish it was instant. But I want that analogue feel without the analogue burden.

I keep these memories, looking through old photos with a wash of nostalgia. Each tell a different story, but the same one every time.

The photographs, while taken quickly and blasé, tell a story once only told through cheap disposable cameras. While you think they are poor imitations, I see them as an homage to a time when we were children documenting our family trips. This lens adapter is a return to our childlike innocence and spontaneity.

The loudness of noise is a link to the past. A link to a time when we waited for the one hour film developer to process our memories.

Nostalgia — it sells.
